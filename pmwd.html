<h1>Project Management</h1>
</br>
<p>Project management helps you plan and execute your tasks that lead to the sucess of your project. <br>In short, it is the management of:<br>
-Scope<br>
-This determines how much you can do in your project and is usually a function of time. Given time, anything is achieveable.<br>
-Time<br>
-How much time do you have to complete your project. This is the main factor in most projects. The management of time is perhaps, the most important aspects of project management.<br>
-Resources<br>
-This is the material, personnel, situations that you have to work with. Think about a project to build a wall, before you can even start, you need to assess what materials are required, order and have it delivered, well before you can even start to build.<br>
-Results<br>
-Everyone looks for a successful project. What happens if you do not have enough time or resources, what can you show to qualify what you have done.</p><br>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control is the management of changes to documents, software, web sites and other collections of information. In usual practise, the change of such documentation is done by labelling the filename or document with a number or letter code e.g. v1.01, v4a.</p><br>
<h3>Reasons for version control:</h3><br>
<p>-Made a change to the work<br>
-Lost work or had a backup that was too old<br>
-Maintain multiple versions of the assignment<br>
-See the difference between two (or more) versions of your work<br>
-Prove that a particular change broke orfixed a section of your work<br>
-Review the history of some work<br>
-Wanted to submit a change to someone elseâ€™s work, in collaboration with yours<br>
-Share your work, or let other people help work on your assignment<br>
-Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where when and by whom<br>
-Experiment with a new feature without interfering with the current working assignment</p><br>
